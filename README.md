# Welcome to our project README.

The Purpose of this notebook is to provide 3 business recomendations backed by data analysis.
Each of our suggestions will have code associated with them. 

This code will demonstrate:
* How we accessed the data.
* How we cleaned the data.
* How we filtered the data. 
* How we visualized the data.

These steps allowed us to confidently arrive at 3 strong business reccomendations for our client, **Computing Vision**
