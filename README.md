# Welcome to our project README.

The main files in this Repo are "ProjectNotebook.ipynb", "Presentation.pdf", and the data sets contained in "zippedData"

The files contents are as follows:
* Project Notebook - Contains all of the code we utilized in this project. 
    *  It has all be formatted to make it easy to read through and undertand the flow.
    *  Contains markdown text in key areas to better describes the text.
* Presentation - The presentation is a PDF version of our powerpoint that we delivered to CV.
* zippedData - This folder contains all of the data sets that we used in our code. 
    *  If you wish to use this code, you will have to make sure that your paths to the files match the location of the files.

These files and our analysis allowed us to confidently arrive at 3 strong business reccomendations for our client, **Computing Vision**

Computing Vision is a technology company with a passion for what is next. They came to us with the idea of entering the film industry but did not know where to start.

It was our goal with this repository, to give CV 3 solid, data backed buisiness recommendations for CV to deploy when entering into this new venture.

The 3 questions we aim to answer are:
* Is there a certain month in which movies tend to perform the best financially?
* Which genre of movies tend to get the best ratings?
* What is the most ideal runtime for our chosen type of film?

To answer these questions we leveraged two databases, **IMDB**, and **The numbers**

IMDB is a premier online film database. It is well known as the worldâ€™s most popular 
authoritative source when it comes to anything film related.

The Numbers is a website that provides detailed financial
analysis about movies & films.

This data allowed us to produce the following visualizations (which you can see the code for in our notebook):

The findings of our statistical inference was as follows:
There is a statistically significant decrease in rating performance for
documentaries with shorter run times. Thus, we can reject the Null Hypothesis.

**This means that when releasing a documentary (the highest rated genre), CV should shoot for a film that is 100 minutes or more.**

## In Summary
* CV should release their film in May to make the most money
* CV should release a Documentary to achieve the highest rating
* CV should release a Documentary that is 100 minutes (or more) long.
